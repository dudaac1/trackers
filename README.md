# 🗃 Trackers
Some helpful tools to help in organization through day-life. 

## 📖 About
An application created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to exercise and learn:
- use of HTML elements and identifiers;
- use of CSS, mainly flexbox;
- function implementation;
- responsivity (not implemented yet);
- data storage (currently using _local storage_).

### 🗳 Habit Tracker
This is the most functional one. Works monthly and allows to track some activities that it is wanted to be done every day by showing a checkbox for every day. When the activity is completed, the user needs to check that day. It saves data through _local storage_.

### ⏲ Pomodoro Tracker
It will save the time spent in activies through the Pomodoro technique. The timer already works and interval and pomodoro time values are saved through _local storage_. 
Based on [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/).

### 📋 Year Planning
Allows a year vision so it can be possible to plan the year. Shows every month and every day in that month (which can be hidden). There isn't data preservation.

## 🧱 Currently working for:
-  a better visual organization for the habit tracker page;
-  save data about times correctly, change the name of the activity, show properly the activity and time spent and fix the empty data when there's no values saved for the pomodoro page;
-  use responsivity in the year planner for a better visual in differente screen sizes, change the html organization created through javascript and save data.
