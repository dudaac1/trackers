# 🗃 Trackers
Some helpful tools to help in organization through day-life. 

## 📖 About
An application created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to exercise and learn:
- use of HTML elements and identifiers;
- use of CSS, mainly flexbox and grid layout;
- function implementation;
- responsiviness;
- data storage (currently using _local storage_).

### 📅 Habit Tracker
A tracker that allows to visualize activities which are wanted to become a habit, i. e. to be done daily. It shows a checkbox for every day of the month for every activity inserted by the user, granted access to mark only the current day and four days before this one. Saves data through _local storage_.

### ⏲ Pomodoro Tracker
It will save the time spent in activies through the Pomodoro technique. The timer already works and interval and pomodoro time values are saved through _local storage_. A lot of improvements are required. Based on [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/).

### 📋 Year Planning
Allows a monthly vision so it can be possible to plan the year. Shows every month and every day in that month (which can be hidden). Saves data through _local storage_ (needs improvement).

## 🧱 Currently working for:
-  being able to seen previous months and statistics for the habit tracker;
-  save data about times correctly, change the name of the activity, show properly the activity and time spent and fix the empty data when there's no values saved for the pomodoro page;
-  being able to see and plan others years in the year planner.
